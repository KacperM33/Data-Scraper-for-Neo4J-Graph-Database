# üåç Data Scraper for Neo4J Graph Database

This project was developed to scrape data from a web application about **animals around the world** and store it as nodes and relationships between them in a Neo4J graph database.

## üìö About This Project

This project was completed as the final assignment for the *Semantic Networks* course during my engineering studies.

## üß∞ Development Tools

- Python 3.11
- [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com) (for graph database)
- [Beautiful-Soup-4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (for data scraping)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality

- **Data scraping:** A script designed to collect data from a web application.
- **Integration with Neo4J:** Creates nodes and relationships between them in a Neo4J graph database.

## üìù How the scraper works

The script connects to already existing **Neo4J database** and creates nodes and relationships based on the scraped data. The data is retrieved from the [Ekologia.pl](https://www.ekologia.pl/atlas-zwierzat/) website.
<br>To achieve this, the script sends an HTTP request to the target URL, downloads the full HTML content of the page, and then processes the hypertext using the **Beautiful-Soup-4** library.

## üåê Graph Database Structure

The database contains a total of **2,827** nodes and **9,968** relationships.

### üî∏ Nodes are divided into **six** main categories:

- Zwierzƒôta (Animals) - a single node serving as the root for all animal-related categories
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f7001b6-5567-4fa6-b951-48aceed9a95a)

- **"Zwierze" (Animal)** - a node representing an individual animal

- **"Lokacje" (Locations)** - a single node acting as the root for all location-related nodes

- **"Lokacja" (Single location)**  - a node representing a specific location (e.g., country or continent)

- **"Podkategoria" (Subcategory)** - a node representing a subcategory (subspecies) of animals
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39914e08-b156-4c5d-b150-1018820aa217)

- **"Kategoria" (Main category)** - a node representing a main category (species) of animals

### üî∏ Relationships are divided into **seven** main types:

- **"SƒÑ_HIPONIMEM_OD" (ARE_HYPONYMS_OF)** - connects specific animal categories to the general "Zwierzƒôta" (Animals) node

- **"NALE≈ªY_DO_KATEGORII" (BELONGS_TO_CATEGORY)** - indicates which main category a subcategory belongs to

- **"ZAWIERA_PODKATEGORIE" (CONTAINS_SUBCATEGORIES)** - indicates which subcategories are included in a main category

- **"JEST_PODKATEGORII" (IS_SUBCATEGORY_OF)** - shows which subcategory an animal belongs to (if applicable)

- **"JEST_KATEGORII" (IS_CATEGORY_OF)** - shows which main category an animal belongs to

- **"TO_HIPONIM_OD" (THIS_IS_A_HYPONYM_FROM)** - connects specific locations (countries, continents, etc.) to the general "Lokacje" (Locations) node

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b722a543-5233-40ef-a260-d344dd6dcc2d)

- **"WYSTƒòPUJE_W" (OCCURRING_IN)** - indicates the locations where a given animal can be found
